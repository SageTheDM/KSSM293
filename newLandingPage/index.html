          Hi, I'm Luca Burger, a 17-year-old Swiss student with a passion for technology and the great outdoors. Born on November 16, 2005, I'm currently attending the Informatik Mittelschule (IMS) in Sargans.

          As a strong advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS), I'm proud to support the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In my free time, you can find me coding, capturing life's moments through photography with my trusty Fujifilm XT3, or riding my 1996 Harley Davidson Sportster 1200cc.

          <p>
            While school sometimes tests my patience, it’s also the place where I find the inspiration to grow. The Kantonschule Sargans and the IMS program continue to shape not only my technical skills but also my resilience and determination.
