          Hi, I'm Luca Burger, a 17-year-old Swiss student with a passion for
          technology and the great outdoors. Born on November 16, 2005, I'm
          currently attending the Informatik Mittelschule (IMS) in Sargans.

          <p>
            While school sometimes tests my patience, it’s also the place where
            I find the inspiration to grow. The Kantonschule Sargans and the IMS
            program continue to shape not only my technical skills but also my
            resilience and determination.

        <p>
          In my free time, I love experimenting with code and working on smaller
          projects. These include everything from creating this website to
          running various tests or revisiting and refining old school
          assignments. Coding has always been more than just a skill—it's a way
          for me to explore new ideas, gain knowledge, push the boundaries of my
          creativity, and tackle challenging problems. I find immense joy in
          turning concepts into reality through code, which constantly keeps me
          inspired to improve.

        <h1>Interstellar Development</h1>
        <p>
          A huge thanks to my friend Patrick, who kept pushing me to code and
          supporting me throughout this journey. Without his encouragement, this
          project wouldn't be where it is today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interstellar Development is driven by our passion for free and
          open-source software. The Free Software Foundation (FSF) has been a
          major inspiration for us. Their philosophy on user freedom and open
          collaboration deeply influences our work, and we strive to carry that
          vision forward with every project we undertake.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we're trying to achieve is simple but important: to build
          high-quality software that is freely available to everyone, and to
          create a space where open-source gaming can thrive. We want to develop
          games and tools that are not only accessible across platforms but also
          built on principles of openness and community.
