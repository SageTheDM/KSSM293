        <h2>Welcome to the overview!</h2>
        <p>
          On November 16, 2005, I was born in the picturesque country of
          Switzerland, and since then, I've had a passion for exploring life.
          Growing up, I discovered my love for various hobbies. This website
          provides an overview of my journey. I began my studies at an
          Informatics school in the summer of 2023, excited to expand my
          knowledge of the digital world with the support of family and friends.
          In conclusion, I'm grateful for the support of my loved ones and the
          joy these experiences bring into my life. I look forward to continuing
          my exploration.
