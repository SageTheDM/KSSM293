                <br></br>
                <P>On the auspicious day of 16th November in the year 2005, I came into this world with an insatiable curiosity and an unwavering passion for exploring the beauty of life. My birthplace is none other than the breathtakingly picturesque country of Switzerland, which has remained my humble abode till the present day. As I grew up, I discovered one of my many hobbies, which is photography and videography. <br></br>

                Over the years, I have amassed a collection of photographic and videographic equipment, which has been either gifted by my generous godfather or self-bought with my hard-earned money. However, it was not until the year 2020 that I finally got my hands on a real camera and began to capture the mesmerizing moments of life. <br></br>
                
                My camera of choice is the Fujifilm-XT3, which allows me to make all the settings manually with its analog buttons, giving me the freedom to unleash my creativity and capture my vision in its purest form. Despite my relatively short journey in the world of photography, I am constantly learning and growing, honing my skills to become the best version of myself. <br></br>
                
                As I embark on a new chapter of my life by attending an Informatics school this summer, I have decided to create this website to expand my knowledge and understanding of the digital world. With the guidance of my family and friends, I am able to pursue my passion and take my photography and videography skills to new heights. <br></br>
                
                In conclusion, I am deeply grateful for the unwavering support of my loved ones and the joy that photography and videography brings into my life. I am excited about what the future holds for me and look forward to continuing my journey of discovery and exploration through the lens of my camera.</P>

            <h1>This Website</h1>
            <section id="section2" class="column">
                <p>Welcome to my website, which I have created to showcase my amateur photography and videography work. As a novice photographer and videographer, I have captured a few moments of life that I found appealing. My website is simply a platform for me to share these experiences with others.<br></br>

                    Here, you will find a collection of my photographs and videos, which were mostly taken with my Fujifilm-XT3 camera. I enjoy using its analog buttons to adjust the settings manually, which gives me a little creative freedom. While I am not a professional, each image and video that I share is a reflection of my artistic vision and my passion for photography and videography.<br></br>
                    
                    My hope is to not only share my work, but to also provide insights into my creative process. I believe that every photograph and video has a story to tell, and I aim to share these stories through my work. Whether it's a landscape, portrait, or a simple moment in time, I strive to capture the essence of every subject.<br></br>
                    
                    I am aware that my work is not perfect, and there are many talented photographers and videographers out there who have far more experience and skills than I do. Nonetheless, I am excited about the future of this website and the possibilities it holds. I am constantly learning and growing as a photographer and videographer, and I hope to improve my work as I continue to explore this art form.<br></br>
                    
                    Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope that my work inspires you to see the beauty in everyday life.</p>
