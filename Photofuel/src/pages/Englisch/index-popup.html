                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                <p>On the auspicious day of 16th November in the year 2005, I came into this world with an insatiable
                    curiosity and an unwavering passion for exploring the beauty of life. My birthplace is none other
                    than the breathtakingly picturesque country of Switzerland, which has remained my humble abode till
                    the present day. As I grew up, I discovered one of my many hobbies, which is photography and
                    videography. <br></br>

                    Over the years, I have amassed a collection of photographic and videographic equipment, which has
                    been either gifted by my generous godfather or self-bought with my hard-earned money. However, it was
                    not until the year 2020 that I finally got my hands on a real camera and began to capture the
                    mesmerizing moments of life. <br></br>

                    My camera of choice is the Fujifilm-XT3, which allows me to make all the settings manually with
                    its analog buttons, giving me the freedom to unleash my creativity and capture my vision in its
                    purest form. Despite my relatively short journey in the world of photography, I am constantly
                    learning and growing, honing my skills to become the best version of myself. <br></br>

                    As I embark on a new chapter of my life by attending an Informatics school this summer, I have
                    decided to create this website to expand my knowledge and understanding of the digital world. With
                    the guidance of my family and friends, I am able to pursue my passion and take my photography and
                    videography skills to new heights. <br></br>

                    In conclusion, I am deeply grateful for the unwavering support of my loved ones and the joy that
                    photography and videography brings into my life. I am excited about what the future holds for me
                    and look forward to continuing my journey of discovery and exploration through the lens of my
                    camera.</p>

            <h2>This Website</h2>
            <section id="section2" class="column">
                <p>Welcome to my website, which I have created to showcase my amateur photography and videography
                    work. As a novice photographer and videographer, I have captured a few moments of life that I found
                    appealing. My website is simply a platform for me to share these experiences with others.<br></br>

                    Here, you will find a collection of my photographs and videos, which were mostly taken with my
                    Fujifilm-XT3 camera. I enjoy using its analog buttons to adjust the settings manually, which gives
                    me a little creative freedom. While I am not a professional, each image and video that I share is a
                    reflection of my artistic vision and my passion for photography and videography.<br></br>

                    My hope is to not only share my work, but to also provide insights into my creative process. I
                    believe that every photograph and video has a story to tell, and I aim to share these stories
                    through my work. Whether it
                                    Apart from showcasing my work, this website also serves as a learning platform for me. As I continue
                to explore the world of digital media and improve my skills, I will be updating this website
                regularly with new content and insights. I invite you to join me on this journey and explore the
                beauty of life through my lens.<br></br>

                Thank you for visiting my website and taking the time to learn more about my passion for
                photography and videography. I hope you enjoy browsing through my work as much as I enjoy creating
                it.<br></br>

                Sincerely,<br></br>
