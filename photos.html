        Hi, I'm Luca Burger, a 17-year-old Swiss student with a passion for
        technology and the great outdoors. Born on November 16, 2005, I'm
        currently attending the Informatik Mittelschule (IMS) in Sargans.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a strong advocate for free and open-source software (FOSS), I'm
        proud to support the Free Software Foundation (FSF). In my free time,
        you can find me coding, capturing life's moments through photography
        with my trusty Fujifilm XT3, or riding my 1996 Harley Davidson
        Sportster 1200cc.
      </p>
      <h2>My Projects and Journey</h2>
      <p>I'm excited to share my involvement in the open-source project</p>
      <a href="https://interstellardevelopment.org/"
        >Interstellar Development</a
      >
      <p>, which I'm working on with some friends.</p>
      <p>
        As I continue to explore my passions, I'm grateful for the support of
        my loved ones and the joy these experiences bring into my life. I'm
        looking forward to continuing my journey and sharing my story with
        you.
      </p>
      <h2>A Little More About My Background</h2>

        for life. Growing up, I discovered my love for various hobbies, and
